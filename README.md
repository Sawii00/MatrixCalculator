# MatrixCalculator
Basic Matrix Calculator 
Simple implementation of a Matrix calculator capable of computing most of the basic operations.
- ImprovedMatrix is an improved implementation based upon a single dimensional array, rather than a 2D-array to increase performance
- SIMDMatrix is an improved implementation based upon the employment of the AVX2 registers available on newer processor to compute operations on the array faster. (2-10x speedup)
